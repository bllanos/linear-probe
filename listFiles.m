function [ names ] = listFiles(wildcard)
% LISTFILES  List files matching a wildcard
%
% ## Syntax
% names = listFiles(wildcard)
%
% ## Description
% names = listFiles(wildcard)
%   Return file names matching the wildcard as a cell array.
%
% ## Input Arguments
%
% wildcard -- Input filename wildcard
%   A wildcard expression for `ls()`, containing the path, if the desired
%   files are located in a different directory from the current directory.
%   (i.e. The wildcard is used as-is - This function does not add any
%   contextual information.)
%
% ## Output Arguments
%
% names -- Filepaths and names
%   A cell vector, where each element is a character containing the name
%   and path of a file in the output of `ls()`.
%
% ## Notes
% - This function treats Windows systems as a special case, and assumes
%   that `ls()` has Linux-specific behaviour on all other systems.
